## Introduction
This project is a collection of interactive prototypes that demonstrate the integration of Tween.js and Ammo.js libraries to create engaging and interactive experiences. The prototypes offer different functionalities and experiences, ranging from interactive characters to shooting targets.

## Prototypes
### Sheppy the Explorer
Sheppy the Explorer prototype showcases an interactive character that can perform various actions. Users can control the character's movements and trigger actions such as jumping, whistling, standing up, sitting down, and more.

### Target Shooting
The Target Shooting prototype provides an interactive shooting experience. Users can aim and shoot at moving targets to score points. The prototype utilizes Ammo.js physics for realistic interactions.

### AI Art Proposal
The AI Art Proposal prototype presents AI-generated art compositions. It displays different versions of images created using AI art tools like goArt and hotpot. Each image pair consists of an AI-generated version produced with goArt and another version produced with hotpot.
